## Current stage
The project has just started, although some commits have already been made.

It is build following a mobile-first approach, using **React** and **Redux**. 

At the moment, the navbar has been implemented through a first iteration and it is fully responsive for mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
Also, the aside filter (category, department, maximum and minimum price) has been made responsive, with some basic functionalities.

Hereafter, it is possible to appreciate the current stage of the project.
